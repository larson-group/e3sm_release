    Updating the clubb core and silhs version files

    Fixed errors in src/DataReader.py:
    Changed attribute name to varname to better reflect its purpose
    Fixed signature of __del__ function (destructor) of the DataReader class
    Fixed function cleanup that is called by the destructor of the DataReader class:
    self.nc_datasets' structure seems to have changed, so the closing loop had to be adjusted.
    Small change to description of DataReader's __getStartEndIndex__ function.

    Pyplotgen Changes:
    * Resolved a minor and difficult to reproduce bug where ncdf data that didn't contain the full range of time values (i.e. if time averaging from 181-360, but data only had 181-310) pyplotgen wouldn't average properly (it would skip the last index)
    * Changed ARM's time from 541 -> 540. This makes it consistent with the clubb cases (uses 540), but makes it inconsistent with the wrf case (uses 541)
    * Increased clubb's priority when plotting so that clubb would get the red/blue color scheme first
    * Added additional variable names to some coamps variables (often uses 'q' in place of 'r', but some coamps datasets expect 'r')
    * This may become Pyplotgen v1.0

    Pyplotgen Changes:
    * Synced time average intervals with plotgen clubb cases
    * Clean up time index determination
    * Added coamps les output to bomex case
    * Added wrf variable names to LiquidMP variable group (although wrf seems to only plot them as 0s)
