    Updating the clubb core and silhs version files

    I added the 2 new parameters in the simple xp3 equation (for PDF
    types other than ADG1) to the list of CLUBB tunable parameters.
    
    The results in GrADS output files from this revision are an exact match
    to the results in GrADS output files from the previous revision for all
    cases.

    This xp3_coef_ parameters produce new hybrid PDF results similar to the old
    ones for a starting point.

    I updated the xp3 calculation for PDF types other than ADG1.
    
    ADG1 is stuck into using the LG 2005 ansatz, exactly as written.
    
    Other PDF types are not stuck using this.  Rather than re-invent the wheel,
    these other PDF types can still use the LG 2005 ansatz equation, but
    sigma_sqd_w_zt (specific to ADG1) has been replaced with a tunable function
    relavant to other PDF types.  This tunable function is called xp3_coef_fnc.
    
    The results in GrADS output files from the previous revision are an exact match
    to the results in GrADS output files from the current revision for all cases
    for the default ADG1 PDF.

    I am changing the new hybrid PDF's calculation of F_w to use
    tunable parameter gamma (technically, the gamma_Skw_fnc).
    
    In the ADG1 PDF, when gamma_Skw_fnc goes to 0, the standard
    deviations of w in each PDF component both go to 0, and the
    spread between the PDF component means of w is at its maximum.
    When gamma_Skw_fnc goes to 1, the standard deviations of w in
    each PDF component become large, and the spread between the PDF
    component means of w becomes small.
    
    The new hybrid PDF is based on the same concept, except that I
    had been using a hard-wired 0.75 in the place of gamma or the
    gamma_Skw_fnc.  Re-using the tunable parameters for gamma here
    makes sense, since it's the same concept and this makes tuning
    easier.

    I am updating the clubb_ list of namelist parameters used in E3SM
    to include every parameter that E3SM has customized in CLUBB.
    The goal is to make it so E3SM does not need to customize the
    CLUBB side of E3SM-CLUBB at all, making future upgrades easier.

    Fixed errors in src/DataReader.py:
    Changed attribute name to varname to better reflect its purpose
    Fixed signature of __del__ function (destructor) of the DataReader class
    Fixed function cleanup that is called by the destructor of the DataReader class:
    self.nc_datasets' structure seems to have changed, so the closing loop had to be adjusted.
    Small change to description of DataReader's __getStartEndIndex__ function.

    I added E3SM customizations to CLUBB's master branch.  This is meant
    for updating CLUBB in the E3SM master branch.
