    Updating the clubb core and silhs version files

    I accidentally committed a "stats_fmt = 'grads'" overwrite with the
    last commit.  That was purely meant to double check for bit-for-bitness
    (since netCDF doesn't work to that effect since the new parameter is
    written to the output files), and wasn't meant to be permanently committed.

    I added altitude_threshold to the list of CLUBB's tunable parameters.
    
    The results in GrADS output files from this revision are an exact match to the
    results in GrADS output files from the previous revision for all cases.
    
    However, NetCDF output files are not an exact match, owing to the presence
    of the new tunable parameter listed in the output files.  That technically
    makes this revision BIT_CHANGING.

    I pared down subprogram pairs again, this time for mean advection.
    
    The results from this revision are an exact match to the result from
    the previous revision for all cases.

    Updated README.md to contain description for generating time-height plots.
    Simultaneously, the sys_admin repo's PyPlotgen Usage wiki entry now merely links to the CLUBB repo's pylotgen page where the README.md content is diplayed.

    I have pared two subprograms down to one again, this time for the
    subprograms found in module diffusion.
    
    As part of this, the calls to diffusion (for turbulent advection)
    in advance_microphys_module.F90 needed to be upgraded to use the
    fully optimized version of the code. As a result, this revision
    is BIT_CHANGING, but only for cases that use microphysics. A print
    out of the LHS array from the call to diffusion shows that numbers
    are in agreement until you reach the point of numerical roundoff.
