    I am committing a bug fix to the invrs_tau_zm equation that was
    introduced with the code merge from E3SM.  I am also adding some
    changes to the clubb_api_module that should have been brought over
    at that time.  This commit is BIT_CHANGING with the bug fix.

    This commit replaces division by tau with multiplication by inverse tau in most cases.  It is BIT_CHANGING, not only because the results change (only very slightly in some cases, but more significantly in sensitive cases like ARM_97, RICO, etc.) but also because some of the old tau_*_zm or tau_*_zt output variables are replaced with invrs_tau_* variables, hence the netcdf files will differ and there are minor changes to stats input files.  Spurious source test also needed to be slightly modified to accommodate a new variable fed into the advance_xm_wpxp subroutine.
    
    There is also some minor cleanup.
    
    See issue #899.

    Pyplotgen changes:
    
    1. Adding VariableGroupTaus variable group to all cases so we can see Brunt-Vaisala freq. squared and the invrs_tau_* quantities for all cases.
    2. Minor change to output handling: Still displays the # of TOTAL plotted, but I got rid of the percentage, since it doesn't carry much information when the threads keep starting new cases and increasing the total number of cases to be plotted.

    Update run_clubb_conv_test.bash
    
    It occurred to me that some of the time steps we'd been using don't divide evenly into 1 hour, meaning they are not all ending on the same time step.  Slightly modifying some of the time steps so that all divide into 3600 and all runs end on the same time step, so we are comparing apples to apples.
