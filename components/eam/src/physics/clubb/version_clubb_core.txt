    I fixed the LMM stepping bug that was affecting E3SM (because
    l_predict_upwp_vpwp is false over there) in advance_xm_wpxp_module.F90.
    I also added it to all predictive fields.
    
    The results in NetCDF output files from this revision is an exact match to the
    results in NetCDF output files from the previous revision for all cases because
    LMM stepping is turned off by default.

    CLUBB and pyplotgen changes:
    
    1. Putting smoothing on thlm before the Brunt-Vaisala frequency calculation.  We find this helps smooth oscillations in that variable, see issue #894.  Also fixing spelling mistake in stats_zm_module.F90, and adding bv_freq_sqd to nightly_stats.in.  For all these reasons this commit is BIT_CHANGING, but only the thlm smoothing will change the physical results.
    
    2. Pyplotgen:  I moved Brunt-Vaisala to VariableGroupBase.py so it should show up in the nightly plots, I got rid of VariableGroupTaus from the default Case definitions, and made a couple other minor changes including making the solid line thicker for standard CLUBB plots.

    I am committing a bug fix to the invrs_tau_zm equation that was
    introduced with the code merge from E3SM.  I am also adding some
    changes to the clubb_api_module that should have been brought over
    at that time.  This commit is BIT_CHANGING with the bug fix.

    This commit replaces division by tau with multiplication by inverse tau in most cases.  It is BIT_CHANGING, not only because the results change (only very slightly in some cases, but more significantly in sensitive cases like ARM_97, RICO, etc.) but also because some of the old tau_*_zm or tau_*_zt output variables are replaced with invrs_tau_* variables, hence the netcdf files will differ and there are minor changes to stats input files.  Spurious source test also needed to be slightly modified to accommodate a new variable fed into the advance_xm_wpxp subroutine.
    
    There is also some minor cleanup.
    
    See issue #899.
